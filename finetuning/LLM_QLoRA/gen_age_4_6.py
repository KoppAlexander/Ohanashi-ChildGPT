     'assistant': 'story title: Where the Wild Things Are\n\nThe night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind, and another. His mother called him "WILD THING!" and Max said "I\'LL EAT YOU UP!" So he was sent to bed without eating anything.\n\nThat very night in Max\'s room a forest grew, and grew, and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around. And an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off through night and day and in and out of weeks and almost over a year, to where the wild things are.\n\nAnd when he came to the place where the wild thimgs are, they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws till Max said "BE STILL!"  and tamed them with the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all and made him king of all wild things. "And now," cried Max, "let the wild rumpus start!"\n\n"Now stop!" Max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper. And Max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all. Then all around from far away across the world he smelled good things to eat. So he gave up being king of where the wild things are.\n\nBut the wild things cried, "Oh please don\'t go. We\'ll eat you up-we love you so!" And Max said, "No!"\n\nThe wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved good-bye.\n\nAnd sailed back over a year, and in and out of weeks, and through a day, and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him, and it was still hot.'}

     'assistant': 'story title: Oh, the Places You\'ll Go!\n\nCongratulations! Today is your day. You\'re off to great places. You\'re off and away!\n\nYou have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You\'re on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU  are the guy who\'ll decide where to go.\n\nYou\'ll look up and down streets. Look \'em over with care. About some you will say, "I don\'t choose to go there." With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, you\'re too smart to go down any not-so-good street. And you may not find any you\'ll want to go down. In that case, of course,  you\'ll head straight out of town.\n\nIt\'s opener there in the wide open air. Out there things can happen and frequently do to people as brainy and footsy as you. And when things start to happen, don\'t worry. Don\'t stew. Just go right along. You\'ll start happening too.\n\nOh! The places you\'ll go! You\'ll be on your way up! You\'ll be seeing great sights! You\'ll join the high fliers who soar to high heights. You won\'t lag behind, because you\'ll have the speed. You\'ll pass the whole gang and you\'ll soon take the lead. Wherever you fly, you\'ll be best of the best. Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.\n\nExcept when you don\'t. Because, sometimes, you won\'t. I\'m sorry to say so but, sadly, it\'s true that Bang-ups and Hang-ups can happen to you.\n\nYou can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch. And your gang will fly on. You\'ll be left in a lurch. You\'ll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump. And the chances are, then, that you\'ll be in a slump. And when you\'re in a slump, you\'re not in for much fun. Un-slumping yourself is not easily done.\n\nYou will come to a place where the streets are not marked. Some windows are lighted. But mostly they\'re darked. A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin! Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in? How much can you lose? How much can you win? And IF you go in, should you turn left or right... or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe not quite? Or go around back and sneak in from behind Simple it\'s not, I\'m afraid you will find, for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.\n\nYou can get so confused that you\'ll start into race down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, headed, i fear, toward a most useless place. The waiting place... ...for people just waiting. Waiting for a train to go or a bus to come or a plane to go or the mail to come, or the rain to go or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow or waiting around for a Yes or a No or waiting for their hair to grow. Everyone is just waiting. Waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite or waiting around for Friday night or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake or a pot to boil, or a Better Break or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants or a wig with curls, or Another Chance. Everyone is just waiting.\n\nNO! That\'s not for you! Somehow you\'ll escape all that waiting and staying. You\'ll find the bright places where Boom Bands are playing. With banner flip-flapping, once more you\'ll ride high! Ready for anything under the sky. Ready because you\'re that kind of a guy!\n\nOh, the places you\'ll go! There is fun to be done! There are points to be scored! There are games to be won. And the magical things you can do with that ball will make you the winning-est winner of all. Fame! You\'ll be famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.\n\nExcept when they don\'t. Because, sometimes, they won\'t. I\'m afraid that sometimes you\'ll play lonely games too. Games you can\'t win \'cause you\'ll play against you. All alone! Whether you like it or not. Alone will be something you\'ll be quite a lot. And when you\'re alone, there\'s a very good chance you\'ll meet things that scare you right out of your pants. There are some, down the road between hither and yon, that can scare you so much you won\'t want to go on.\n\nBut on you will go though the weather be foul. On you will go though your enemies prowl. On you will go through the Hackken-Kraks howl. Onward up many a frightening creek, though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak.\n\nOn and on you will hike. And I know you\'ll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are. You\'ll get mixed up, of course, as you already know. You\'ll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go. So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that life\'s a great balancing act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And never mix up your right foot with your left. And will you succeed? Yes! You will, indeed! (98 and 1/4 percent guaranteed.) KID, YOU\'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!\n\nSo... be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray or Mordecai Ali Van Alle O\'Shea, you\'re off to great places! Today is your day! Your mountain is waiting. So... get on your way!'}

     'assistant': 'story title: Room on the Broom\n\nThe witch had a cat and a very tall hat, and long ginger hair which she wore in a plait. How the cat purred and how the witch grinned, as they sat on their broomstick and flew through the wind.\n\nBut how the witch wailed and how the cat spat, when the wind blew so wildly it blew off the hat. "Down!" cried the witch, and they flew to the ground. They searched for the hat but no hat could be found.\n\nThen out of the bushes on thundering paws there bounded a dog with the hat in his jaws. He dropped it politely, then eagerly said (as the witch pulled the hat firmly down on her head), "I am a dog, as keen as can be. Is there room on the room for a dog like me?" "Yes!" cried the witch, and the dog clambered on. The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh! they were gone.\n\nOver the fields and the forests they flew. The dog wagged his tail and the stormy wind blew. The witch laughed aloud and held on to her hat. But away blew the bow from her long ginger plait! "Down!" cried the witch, and they flew to the ground. They searched for the bow, but no bow could be found.\n\nThen out from a tree, with an ear-splitting shriek, there flapped a green bird with the bow in her beak. She dropped it politely and bent her head low, then said (as the witch tied her plait in a bow), "I am a bird, as green as can be. Is there room on the broom for a bird like me?" "Yes!" cried the witch. So the bird fluttered on. The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh! they were gone.\n\nOver the reeds and the rivers they flew. The bird shrieked with glee and the stormy wind blew. They shot through the sky to the back of beyond. The witch clutched her bow but let go of her wand. "Down!" cried the witch, and they flew to the ground. They searched for the wand but no wand could be found.\n\nThen all of a sudden from out of a pond, leapt a dripping wet frog with a dripping wet wand. He dropped it politely, then said with a croak (as the witch dried the wand on a fold of her cloak), "I am a frog, as clean as can be. Is there room on the broom for a frog like me?" "Yes!" said the witch, so the frog bounded on. The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh! they were gone.\n\nOver the moors and the mountains they flew. The frog jumped for joy and ... the broom snapped in two! Down fell the cat and the dog and the frog. Down they went tumbling into a bog. The witch\'s half broomstick flew into a cloud, and the witch heard a roar that was scary and loud ... "I am a dragon, as mean as can be. And I\'m planning to have witch and chips for my tea!" "No!" cried the witch, flying higher and higher. The dragon flew after her, breathing out fire.\n\n"Help!" cried the witch, flying down to the ground. She looked all around but no help could be found. The dragon drew nearer and, licking his lips, said "Maybe this once I\'ll have witch without chips." But just as he planned to begin on his feast, from out of a ditch rose a horrible beast. It was tall, dark and sticky, and feathered and furred. It had four frightful heads, it had wings like a bird, and its terrible voice when it started to speak was a yowl and a growl and a croak and a shriek. It dripped and it squelched as it strode from the ditch, and it said to the dragon, "Buzz off! That\'s my witch!" The dragon drew back and he started to shake. "I\'m sorry!" he spluttered. "I made a mistake. It\'s nice to have met you, but now i must fly." And he spread out his wings and was off through the sky.  Then down flew the bed and down jumped the frog. Down climbed the cat, and "Phew!" said the dog. And, "Thank you, oh, thank you!" the grateful witch cried. "Without you I\'d be in that dragon\'s inside." Then she filled up her cauldron and said with a grin, "Find something, everyone, throw something in!" So the frog found a lily, the cat found a cone, the bird found a twig and the dog found a bone. They threw them all in and the witch stirred them well, and while she was staring she muttered a spell. "Lggety, ziggety zaggety, ZOOM!" Then out rose ... a truly magnificent broom! With seats for the witch and the cat and the dog, a nest for the bird and a shower for the frog. "Yes!" cried the witch, and they all clambered on. The witch tapped the broomstick and whoosh! they were gone.'}

     'assistant': 'story title: The Whales\' Song\n\nLilly\'s grandmother told her a story. "Once upon a time," she said, "the ocean was filled with whales. They were as big as hills. They were as peaceful as the moon. They were the most wondrous creatures you could ever imagine."\n\nLily climbed onto her grandmother\'s lap. "I used to sit at the end of the pier and listen for whales," said Lilly\'s grandmother. "Sometimes I\'d sit there all day and all night. Then suddenly I\'d see them coming toward me from miles away. They moved through the water as if they were dancing."\n\n"But why did they swim to you, Grandma?" asked Lilly. "How did they know you were there?" Lilly\'s grandmother smiled. "Oh, you had to bring them something special. A perfect shell. Or a beautiful stone. And if they liked you, the whales would take your gift and give you something in return."\n\n"What would they give you, Grandma?" asked Lilly. "What did you get from the whales?" Lilly\'s grandmother sighed. "Once or twice," she whispered, "once or twice, I heard them sing."\n\nLilly\'s great-uncle Frederick stomped into the room. "That\'s nothing but a silly old tale!" he snapped. "Whales were important for their meat, and for their bones, and for their blubber. If you have to tell Lily about whales, then tell her something useful. Don\'t fill her head with nonsense. Singing whales, indeed!"\n\nThere were whales here millions of years before there were ships, or cities, or even cave dwellers," continued Lilly\'s grandmother. "People used to say they were magical." "People used to eat them and boil them down for oil!" grumbled Lilly\'s great-uncle Frederick. And he stomped back out of the room.\n\nLil\' dreamt about whales. In her dreams she saw them, as large as mountains and bluer than the sky. In her dreams she heard them singing, their voices like the wind. in her dreams they leapt from the water and called her name.\n\nIn the morning Lilly went down to the ocean, to the place where no one fished or swam or sailed. She walked to the end of the old pier. The water was empty and still. She took a yellow flower out of her pocket and dropped it in the water. "This is for you," she called into the air.\n\nLilly sat at the end of the pier and waited. She waited all morning and all afternoon. Then, as dusk began to fall, Uncle Frederick came down the hill after her. "Enough of this foolishness," he said. "Come on home. You can\'t be dreaming your life away."\n\nThat night Lilly awoke suddenly. The room was bright with moonlight. She sat up and listened. The house was quiet. Lilly climbed out of bed and went to the window. She could hear something in the distance, on the far side of the hill.\n\nShe raced outside and down to the shore. Her heart was pounding as she reached the sea. There, enormous in the ocean, were the whales. They leapt and jumped and spun across the moon. Their singing filled the night. Lilly saw her yellow flower dancing on the spray.\n\nMinutes passed, or maybe hours. Suddenly Lilly felt the breeze rustle her nightgown and the cold nip at her toes. She shivered and rubbed her eyes. Then it seemed the ocean was still again and the night dark and silent. Lilly thought she must have been dreaming. She stood up and turned toward home. Then from far, far away, on the breath of the wind, she heard "Lilly! Lilly!" The whales were calling her name.'}

She always said please and thank you and even put away all her toys. At dinner she ate all her food. "What a big girl you are! the adults would say, and it was good. She grew and learned and laughed and dreamed and grew and grew and grew. And it was good ... until it wasn\'t. "You\'re a big girl aren\'t you."\n\nOne day something big happened. "I can\'t wait for the recital." "I\'m going going to be a rose." "I\'m going to be a daisy." "OMG!" "Look! She is stuck!" "Ha ha ha." "Mooooooo!" "Whale!" "More like moose!" "Help." "Don\'t you think you\'re too big for that!" It made her feel small. The words stung and were hard to shake off. She began to feel, not herself, out of place, exposed, judged, yet invisible.\n\nEveryone had advice but that kind of hurt too. "Hmm that\'s no good. Try this instead." "This is perfect for you. The flower costume won\'t fit. You\'re just too big. Where are you going what did I say?" "Aren\'t you too big to be crying"" "Have you tried being smaller?" "Why can\'t you just fit in?"\n\nOne day she finally let it all out ... and started to see things more clearly. She decided to make more space for herself ... and was able to see a way out. "These are yours. They hurt me." Not everyone understood or even listened. "It\'s just a joke." "It\'s not that serious." "You\'re too sensitive." "I didn\'t mean to hurt you." Some tried ... but they still couldn\'t see that she was just a girl. "I can help you change if you want ..." "No thank you. I like the way I am." And she was good.'}

     'assistant': 'story title: Watercress\n\nWe are in the old Pontiac, the red paint faded by years of glinting Ohio sun, pelting rain, and biting snow. The tops of the cornstalks make lines that zigzag across the horizon. Mom shouts, "Look!" and the car comes to an abrupt, jerking stop. Mom\'s eyes are as sharp as the tip of a dragon\'s claw. Dad\'s eyes grow wide. "Watercress!" they exclaim, two voices heavy with memories.\n\nFrom the depths of the trunk, they unearth a brown paper bag, rusty scissors, and a longing for China. They haul us out of the backseat. We are told to untie our sneakers, peel off our socks, and roll up our jeans. We have to help them gather it. The water in the ditch is cold. It stings my ankles, and the mud squelches up between my toes. A car passes by and I duck my head hoping it\'s no one I know. My parents cut bunches of the small plant, long stringy stems with leaves round as coins. My brother yanks watercress up by the handful, root dripping dirty water onto my shirt, and thrust it close to my face. There are tiny snails clinging to the underside. I squirm away. The bag in my hands grows heavier and heavier with the weight of all the watercress. The paper is soaked and I\'m half afraid half hopeful that the bottom will split, sending all the plants back down into the muck. Finally we load everything, soggy bag, my sopping shirt, our sodden selves, into the car and head home. Our original destination is long forgotten, a memory of something unfinished.\n\nOn the dinner table that night is a dish of watercress, glistening with garlicky oil and freckle with sesame seeds. The mud and snails are long gone but I still don\'t want to eat it. Any of it. I only want to eat vegetables from the grocery store. Mom and Dad press me to try some. "It\'s fresh," Dad says. "It\'s free," Mom says. I shake my head. Free is bad. Free is hand-me-down clothes and roadside trash-heap furniture and now, dinner from a ditch. Mom sighs and disappears into her room, returning with an old photo. "My family," she says, "from before." We stare. Mom never talks about her China family. She points to a small boy as thin as a stem of watercress. "My little brother. Your uncle." We hold our breaths. Mom never told us what happened to him. "During the great famine," she says, "we ate anything we could find, but it was still not enough." I look from my uncle\'s hollow face to the watercress on the table and I am ashamed of being ashamed of my family. I take a bite of watercress and it bites me back with its spicy, peppery taste. It\'s delicate and slightly bitter, like Mom\'s memories of home. Together, we eat it all and make a new memory of watercress.'}

In the story, "black snake" refers to the piplines that leak pollutants.\n\nWater is the first medicine, Nokomis told me. We come from water. It nourished us inside our mother\'s body. As it nourishes us here on Mother Earth. Water is sacred, she said. We stand with our songs and our drums. We are still here. The river\'s rhythm runs through my veins. Runs through my people\'s veins. My people talk of a black snake that will destroy the land. Spoil the water. Poison plants and animals. Wreck everything in its path. When my people first spoke of the black snake, they foretold that it wouldn\'t come for many many years. Now the black snake is here. Its venom burns the land. Courses through the water, making it unfit to drink. Take courage! I must keep the black snake away from my village\'s water. I must rally my people together. To stand for the water. To stand for the land. To stand as one. Against the black snake. We stand with our songs and our drums. We are still here. It will not be easy. We fight for those who cannot fight for themselves; the winged ones,  the crawling ones, the four-legged, the two-legged, the plants, trees, rivers, lakes, the Earth. We are all related. Tears like waterfalls stream down. Tracks down my face. Tracks down my people\'s faces. Water has its own spirit, Nikomis told me. Water is alive.

We are water protectors. We stand! The black snake is in for the fight of its life.\n\nEarth Steward and water protector pledge.

     'assistant': 'story title: Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat\n\nSomewhere in Brooklyn between hearts that thump, double Dutch, and hopscotch and salty mouths that slurp sweet ice, a little boy dreams of being a famous artist. In his house you can tell a serious artist dwells. As he sits at a table with pencils scattered everywhere, Jean-Michel draws from morning until night with a serious face amid a storm of papers. He refuses to sleep until he has created a masterpiece. At night images enchant Jean-Michel\'s mind, and he wakes from his dreams to add one more line. His drawings are not neat or clean, nor does he color inside the lines. They are sloppy, ugly, and sometimes weird, but somehow still beautiful.\n\nHis art comes from his mother, Matilde, a Puerto Rican woman who designs and sews, cooks and cleans, and makes the house look like a stylish magazine. But most important. She lies on the floor and draws with Jean-Michel on his father\'s old work papers. From her he learns that art is not only in the poetry books she reads to him or in the theaters and museums they visit. Art is the street games of little children, in our style and the words that we speak. It is how the messy patchwork of the city creates new meaning for ordinary things.\n\nWhile visiting the museum, they look at his favorite works of art. Reading the story behind each artist, reading the story behind each work. This is how Jean-Michel learns what it means to become a famous artist.\n\nBack at home, he creates art on the floor as his father, Gerard plays jazz records. Mama Matilde cooks arroz con pollo and calls Jean-Michel "Mi Amor." The energy and life of the city can be felt in each line of his drawings.\n\nAs time goes by, Jean-Michel learns that art has a healing power. After a car accident he is scared and confused. Matilde gives him a book to calm his fears. It is filled with pictures of bones, skulls, and other body parts. Jean-Michel draws from it until he knows it all by heart. He is no longer afraid.\n\nBack at home, Jean-Michel\'s body heals, but his heart breaks. His mother\'s mind is not well, and the family breaks. she no longer lies on the floor and draws with Jean-Michel but sits by the window singing only to birds. Jean-Michel is confused and filled with a terrible blues when Matilde can no longer live at home.\n\nHe tries drawing the terrible out of his blues, but things are not the same. As Jean-Michel grows older, he visits his mother when he can, always bringing his artwork to show, telling her that one day it will be in a museum, "when I am a famous artist."\n\nA teenager now, Jean-Michel decides, "Papa, I will be very, very famous one day." With a sly look, a twinkle in his eye, Jean-Michel leaves Brooklyn for New York City, the lower East Side, a concrete jungle where only the tough survive.\n\nDuring the day, dressed in a green jumpsuit splattered with paint, Jean-Michel stays with friends, sleeping on couches and floors, leaving a barrage of collages and poem-filled papers everywhere he goes. At night, Jean-Michel spray-paints the walls downtown with poems and drawings that catch the eye of artists, gallery-goers, and passersby. Under his art, he signs the name "Samoo" instead of "Jean-Michel." Everybody wants to know "Who is Samoo?"\n\nSamoo moves from the street corners to art gallery walls with powerful color composition in line, collaging and painting on anything he can find. His art is still not neat or clean and definitely not inside the lines, but somehow still beautiful. With his magical charm, Jean-Michel draws a crowd, but when it\'s time to work, he prefers to be alone with the radio and TV on full blast. Now in expensive suits splattered with paint, he flips through stacks of magazines and open books, and paints into the night and sometimes for days at a time while sounds and images jump into his head.\n\nJean-Michel, an artist among artists, never doubts one line, creating from a sound track that is all his own. People describe him as radiant, wild, a genius child, but in his heart he is king, so he draws crowns for himself and others he admires.\n\nA grown man now, with the art world in his hands, Jean-Michel still visits his mother when he can. And at his most important shows, above all the critics, fans, and artists he admires, the place of honor is his mother\'s, a queen on a throne. He is now a famous artist!'}
