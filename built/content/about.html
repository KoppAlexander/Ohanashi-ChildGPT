                ChildGPT is an innovative application that creates custom children's stories based on input parameters
                such as age and other preferences. What sets this app apart is its ability to narrate these stories
                using
                an AI-generated voice that mimics a parent or loved one, trained on their voice samples. Additionally,
                the
                app generates captivating images to accompany each story, providing a unique and engaging experience for
                children.
