<font color="red"> Insert a picture of the webpage here </font>

<font color="red">ChildGPT</font> is an innovative application that creates custom children's stories based on input parameters such as age and other preferences. What sets this app apart is its ability to narrate these stories using an AI-generated voice that mimics a parent or loved one, trained on their voice samples. Additionally, the app generates captivating images to accompany each story, providing a unique and engaging experience for children.

## Features

- **Custom Story Generation**: Stories tailored to the child's age and preferences.
- **AI Voice Synthesis**: Narrates stories using a familiar voice (e.g., parent's voice).
- **Image Generation**: Automatically creates illustrations to accompany the stories.
- **Interactive Experience**: Engaging storytelling for children, even when parents can't be there in person.
